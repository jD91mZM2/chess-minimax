# Introduction

This is version `v0` of the chess protocol.
Only breaking versions are counted.
It's something I need to make a website for my crappy-chess-minimax.
I might as well share the specification.

By standard, the chess protocol should be used over a Websocket connection.

**note**: Version 0 (and only version 0!) is allowed to break stuff however it wants.  
Version 1 and above will however only do non-breaking changes without incrementing the
version number.

# Changes since last version

# Specification

This protocol is designed to be easy to parse.  
Every message is a space-separated list of arguments,
where the first argument is the command.

Some messages expect replies from the server.  
These should block until they get a response (or the connection time outs).

## Initialization

Every connection starts with a message from the client -
```
INIT v#
```
where # is a version number.  
The server should immediately reply with
```
ACCEPT
```
or
```
REFUSE
```
You will hear these replies mentioned a lot.  
They are the standard for allowing or denying an action.  
In this case the server should send `ACCEPT` if it supports the version
mentioned in the `INIT` message.
The server should not drop the connection but rather wait for another `INIT` command,  
unless no message has been sent within a short timeout. See [values](#values)

This should set up a chess game. The server chooses what party to play as.  
If the server decides to play black, it should send to the (still waiting!) client.  
```
BLACK
```
Otherwise, it should send
```
WHITE MOVE x y new_x new_y
```
where `x`, `y`, `new_x` and `new_y` are values of the old and new coordinates.  
See more about the `MOVE` command [here](#move).

## Client & Server commands.

### `MOVE`

The `MOVE` command is a command that may be used by both the server and the client.  
It takes values in the following order: X, Y, NEW X, NEW Y.  
Every value is 0-indexed.

Example:
```
MOVE 0 1 0 3
```
This asks to move either the H1 or A1 (depending on the board rotation) piece two steps forward (to H3/A3).

If this is received on the client, it should move the piece without any checking.  
On the server however, it might optionally do a check.  
Regardless, the server has to return either
```
ACCEPT
```
or
```
REFUSE
```

### `CASTLING`

The `CASTLING` command informs that the next two commands describe a castling.  
This is useful to tell the server to check for castlings differently, or not check at all.

Example:
```
CASTLING
MOVE 3 0 1 0
MOVE 0 0 2 0
```

Once again, the client should just obey.  
The server should also reply with
```
ACCEPT
```
or
```
REFUSE
```

## Server-only commands

### `HIGHLIGHT`

The `HIGHLIGHT` command is used to tell the client to highlight different pieces.  
It may have any even amount of argument, as it can highlight multiple pieces.  

Example:
```
HIGHLIGHT 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5
```
*Highlight can be used to inform the client why it can't move there - for example because it would be in check.*

### `INTO-QUEEN`

This command turns the specified piece into a queen.  
This is used by the server when a pawn walks to the edge of the board.

Example:
```
INTO-QUEEN 0 5
```
