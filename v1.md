# Introduction

This is version `v1` of the chess protocol.
Only breaking versions are counted.
It's something I need to make a website for my crappy-chess-minimax.
I might as well share the specification.

# Changes since last version

# Specification

This protocol is designed to be easy to parse.  
Every message is a space-separated list of arguments,
where the first argument is the command.

Some messages expect replies from the server.  
These should block until they get a response (or the connection time outs).

If the client/server receives an invalid message (syntax, utf8, arguments, et.c),  
it may just shut down without further explanation.

**note**: Every command is and should be *case sensitive*.  
`INIT v0` may work, while `init v0` doesn't.

## Initialization

Every connection starts with a message from the client -
```
INIT v#
```
where # is a version number.  
The server should immediately reply with
```
ACCEPT
```
or
```
REFUSE
```
You will hear these replies mentioned a lot.  
They are the standard for allowing or denying an action.  
In this case the server should send `ACCEPT` if it supports the version
mentioned in the `INIT` message.
The server should not drop the connection but rather wait for another `INIT` command,  
unless no message has been sent within a short timeout. See [values](#values)

This should set up a chess game. The server chooses what party to play as.  
If the server decides to play black, it should send to the (still waiting!) client.  
```
BLACK
```
Otherwise, it should send
```
WHITE MOVE old new
```
where `new` and `old` are values of the old and new coordinates.  
See more about the `MOVE` command [here](#move).

## Client & Server commands.

### `MOVE`

The `MOVE` command is a command that may be used by both the server and the client.  
It takes values in the following order: X, Y, NEW X, NEW Y.  
Every value is 0-indexed.

Example:
```
MOVE H1 H3
```
This asks to move either the H1 piece two steps forward H3.

If this is received on the client, it should move the piece without any checking.  
On the server however, it might optionally do a check.  
Regardless, the server has to return either
```
ACCEPT
```
or
```
REFUSE
```
and then its move.

**note**: Position strings should *always* be UPPERCASE.

### `CASTLING`

The `CASTLING` command informs that the next two commands describe a castling.  
This is useful to tell the server to check for castlings differently, or not check at all.

Example:
```
CASTLING
MOVE D1 B1
MOVE A1 C1
```

Once again, the client should just obey.  
The server should also reply with
```
ACCEPT
```
or
```
REFUSE
```
and then its move.

## Server-only commands

### `HIGHLIGHT`

The `HIGHLIGHT` command is used to tell the client to highlight different pieces.  
It may have any even amount of argument, as it can highlight multiple pieces.  

Example:
```
HIGHLIGHT B7 C6 D5 E4
```
*Highlight can be used to inform the client why it can't move there - for example because it would be in check.*

### `INTO-QUEEN`

This command turns the specified piece into a queen.  
This is used by the server when a pawn walks to the edge of the board.

Example:
```
INTO-QUEEN F8
```

## Client-only commands

### `SWAP`

This command simply asks the server to swap sides.  
If the server agrees (if it's supported, perhaps also check if no game has been started),  
it sends
```
ACCEPT
```
otherwise
```
REFUSE
```

# Values

These are suggestions on what magic values to use.  
You may safely disregard anything this suggests.

READ TIMEOUT INIT: 10s  
READ TIMEOUT:      2min
