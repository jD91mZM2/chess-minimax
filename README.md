# Crappy chess minimax

Hello, this is a crappy chess minimax program.  
It was horrible, then @tbodt came along.  
Like always he gave me brilliant ideas for how to fix my shit.  

Example:
I counted kills.  
Now it counts how many pieces are left after all moves combined.

Cleaner code FTW!

Please don't use this seriously, I'm sure there are better programs out there.  
I just needed to learn to make my first minimax algorithm thanks.
