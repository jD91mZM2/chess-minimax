# chess-minimax

This is a chess bot written in Rust, using the minimax algorithm with basic
alpha beta pruning.

NOTE: This branch is not finished yet. It's rewriting the original project to
have a lot cleaner and hopefully faster code. One modification is that it'll
allow playing as both sides at runtime, rather than having it be a compile time
flag.
